// timezone-agnostic (i.e. just because a person was born on the 2nd of the
// month at 2am in New Zealand, that does not mean that they would celebrate
// their birthday on the 1st when they are in Germany, although that would
// be the correct day considering the timezone).
//
// # Inaccuracies
//
// Birthdate may fail to return an accurate birthday, in any of these cases:
//
//  1. The pension insurance number is invalid.
//     In this case, Birthdate returns the zero value of time.Time.
//     You can use [time.Time.IsZero] to check if that is the case.
//
//     Note that Birthdate will not perform a full validity check.
//     Currently, the only case where Birthdate will return a zero time, is
//     when BirthDay is zero, or BirthMonth is outside the valid 1-12 range.
//
//  2. The pension insurance number is valid, but the birthday cannot be
//     determined, because of the special case described in
//     doc of the BirthDay field.
//     In this case, Birthdate returns a valid time that uses the first of the
//     month as day.
//     Check if BirthDay > 31 to determine if this is the case.
//
//  3. The pension insurance number holder is 100 years or older.
//     Since the BirthYear is only two digits, it is not possible to determine
//     the correct century.
//     Birthdate will attempt to guess it, by assuming that the holder is
//     younger than 100 years and picking the century the appropriate century.
